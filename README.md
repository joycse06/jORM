=== Very simple bare bone ORM I wrote for educational purpose ==


Things I learned along the way includes:

* How ORM works under the hood
* dynamic method resolution
* How Laravel resolves static method calls into Non-static private methods
* How to take of take care of the low level differences in different DB drivers and provide a unified high level Interface.
* How PSR autoloaders work and defer the responsibility of loading of class files to the autoloader

and many more things.
